<!-- this is a subheadline -->
I am a PhD student in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (minor in Statistics). I am interested in investigating and representing the microbiome functional genes which are involved in important soil processes. Hopefully my research can help improve the sustainable agriculture. Out of research, I like working on programming, statistics, and data science projects. Always look to collaborate on fun projects!
