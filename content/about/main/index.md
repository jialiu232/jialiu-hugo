  I am interested in promoting sustainable agriculture from the soil microbiome perspective. In particular, I work on improving the detection of microbiome functional genes that are involved in the important soil processes, such as nitrogen cycling. Previously, I developed [MetaFunPrimer](https://github.com/pommevilla/MetaFunPrimer), a command line-based pipeline to design primers for high-throughput qPCR. Learn more about my current project in *PROJECTS* page.
  
  In my free time, I enjoy to read and think with a cup of tea, do sports, just started indoor climbing! I am a passionate learner in data science and programming, enjoying working on related projects both individually and in collaboration.
