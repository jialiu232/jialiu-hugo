The underground microbial universe plays important roles in earth biogeochemical processes. There are around ten billion bacteria in a handful of soil, it is thus challenging to investigate and represent the microbial species profiles as well as their functions. Overall, I am interested in studying how the soil microbial communities interact with the environments and regulate the important soil processes.

As an initial step of this project, I am working on reducing the dimensions of microbial species profiles. More specifically, I am using the autoencoder architecture to develop a latent representation of microbial species profile.
